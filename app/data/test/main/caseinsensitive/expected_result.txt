If the spelling checker reports a spelling mistake which is actually a
deliberate choice an exemption can be made in a few ways:

* Words containing uppercase characters are assumed to be proper nouns and
  ignored.
* Escaping can be achieved through the use of back ticks ` around the word.
* Adding to a custom wordlist wordlist.txt or spelling_wordlist.txt found in any
  sub-directory.
* Adding to the global wordlist https://github.com/resplendent-dev/unanimous
